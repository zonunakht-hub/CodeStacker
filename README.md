## 🌊 Vibe Coding vs Full Stack AI Coding

### Vibe Coding
Vibe coding is how most people use AI to build software today — and it's costing them.

You open a chat, describe what you want, and ask the AI to "just build it." The AI generates code. You paste it in. It kind of works. You ask for a fix. It breaks something else. You paste that fix in. Now something else is wrong. You're not building a product — you're playing whack-a-mole with an AI that has no idea what your actual codebase looks like, no memory of what it did last session, and no plan beyond the last prompt.

Vibe coding works for demos, prototypes, and throwaway scripts. For anything real — it creates technical debt faster than you can ship.

**The symptoms are familiar:**
- AI contradicts itself between sessions
- Generates code that doesn't match your existing patterns
- Adds features you didn't ask for
- Skips documentation and test coverage
- Drifts from the original spec halfway through
- Leaves you asking "what did it actually change?"

### Full Stack AI Coding
Full Stack AI Coding is the professional standard for building production software with AI. It treats your AI assistant as a disciplined engineering partner — not a magic text generator.

It means the AI knows your codebase before it touches it. It plans before it builds. It follows rules you've set. It documents everything it does. It stays on scope. It hands off cleanly between sessions. And when it makes a mistake, it records it so it doesn't make it again.

**Full Stack AI Coding is:**
- Specification-driven — every task starts with a written plan
- Structure-aware — AI reads your actual project before acting
- Traceable — every decision, change, and session is documented
- Rule-governed — behavioral constraints enforced on every request
- Context-managed — memory maintained across sessions and handoffs
- Skill-informed — domain expertise loaded for every technology in the stack

This is how you build real products with AI, at pace, without chaos.

## 🏗️ What is CodeStacker 2.3?

We built CodeStacker because the tools weren't keeping up with how developers actually work with AI. In early iterations, AI coding lacked structure and memory. 

With **version 2.3**, CodeStacker evolves into an Enterprise-Grade **Rigid Architecture** for AI-assisted development. We introduced **Workspaces**, the **Federated Master Index**, and **The Director** prompt gate to enforce strict isolation, traceability, and architectural integrity. 

**That's `.codestacker`.**

`.codestacker` is a persistent, folder-based hierarchical AI agent management system that sits inside your project. It eliminates "prompt-drift" by physically forcing AI models (like Claude or GPT) to operate within strict boundary configurations, separating core tasks from massive feature epics.

One folder. Any AI. Total control.

---

## ✨ Version 2.3 Top-Level Features

- **🏢 Isolated Epic Workspaces** — Massive features are built in dedicated, isolated environments (`Mode Workspace`). This prevents AI context windows from overloading and protects the global state from accidental overwrites.
- **🗂️ Federated Master Index** — Workspaces dynamically sync their findings into a central architecture index (`00_master_index.md`). Models always begin here to understand the overarching system reality.
- **🎬 The Director AI** — Before a single line of code is written in a Workspace, the "Director" AI interviews you to define goals, complexity gates, and attach necessary APIs or tools.
- **🔒 Complexity Governance Gates** — Control the AI's autonomy explicitly: use `Gate Review` for strict human-in-the-loop code review checkpoints, or `Gate Full Auto` for maximum velocity and self-healing.
- **🤖 Specialized Agent Personas** — Deploy experts like "Security Auditor", "QA Tester", and "Vibe Coder" from the `AGENT_REGISTRY.md` to tackle logical sub-tasks governed by The Director.
- **🔑 The Credential Protocol** — Strict enforcement ensuring AI models never write plaintext API keys into the `.codestacker/` memory, relying purely on standard `.env` variables for 100% compliance.
- **🧰 Dynamic Tool Registry** — CodeStacker dynamically scans `TOOL_REGISTRY.md` so the AI knows its exact capabilities (e.g., executing a Postgres CLI or scraping via Firecrawl).
- **📋 Plan-First Workflow** — Every task requires a formalized Mission Plan and checklist. The AI cannot implement until you review and approve it.
- **🚫 Zero Drift** — Strict scope enforcement. Models only work within the approved Mission Plan bounds.
- **📊 Error Reporting & Telemetry** — The AI manages a visual `dashboard.md` within work environments, tracking progress via Mermaid charts and logging all failures seamlessly.

## 🏢 About CoSama

**[cosama.co](https://cosama.co)**

CoSama is the AI development company behind CodeStacker. We build tools, systems, and infrastructure for developers who use AI as a core part of their engineering workflow — not as a shortcut, but as a first-class development partner.

CodeStacker is our answer to the question every serious AI developer eventually asks: *"How do I actually manage this thing?"*

We're building the tooling layer that makes Full Stack AI Coding the default — not the exception.

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Add .codestacker to Your Project

**Option A — One-liner (Mac/Linux)**
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoSama-Ai/CodeStacker/main/install.sh | bash
```

---

**Option B — One-liner (Windows PowerShell)**
```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoSama-Ai/CodeStacker/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

---

**Option C — Git (Manual)**
```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/CoSama-Ai/CodeStacker.git /tmp/cs
cp /tmp/cs/stack.md .
cp -r /tmp/cs/.codestacker .
rm -rf /tmp/cs
```

---

**Option D — ZIP Download**

Download the ZIP from GitHub → **Code → Download ZIP**, extract it, then copy `stack.md` and the `.codestacker/` folder into your project root.

> ⚠️ Windows File Explorer won't show `.codestacker` by default (hidden folder) — use PowerShell or enable "Show hidden items".

### 2. Connect Your AI Tool

The core instruction file is **`stack.md`** — it tells any AI how to operate under `.codestacker`. You have three integration options:

**Option A — Automatic (Recommended)**
Run `Mode Start` or `Mode New Project`. The system detects your existing AI config files (`CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, `AGENTS.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, etc.) and asks to add a reference to `stack.md`. Your existing instructions stay intact.

**Option B — Create New**
If you have no AI config files yet, the system offers to create the appropriate one for your tool, pointing to `stack.md`.

**Option C — Manual**
Tell your AI: *"Read `stack.md` and follow it."*
> ⚠️ Manual mode may conflict with existing tool instructions.

### 3. Start Your First Session

Open a chat with your AI assistant. The system auto-detects first run:

```
You: (start chat)

AI: 🔍 Detected first run — initializing .codestacker...

    I found existing AI instruction files:
    - CLAUDE.md
    → Add .codestacker reference? (A) Add / (B) Manual / (C) Skip

    Please answer a few questions:
    1. What is your project name?
    2. What language/framework?
    3. Do you have existing code?
    4. What's the main goal?
```

### 4. Start Building

Once initialized, use mode commands to control the AI:

```
You: Mode Plan - Add user authentication

AI: 📋 Creating plan with checklist...
    [creates plan in .codestacker/project/plan/]

You: Mode Approved

AI: ✅ Executing plan...
    [implements with full documentation]
```

## 💡 Workflow Examples

### Adding a New Feature

```
You: Mode Plan - Add user profile page with avatar upload

AI: 📋 Reading project structure...
    🔍 Checking existing patterns...

    Plan ready:
    - Create Profile component
    - Add avatar upload handler
    - Update database schema
    - Add tests

    Approve with "Mode Approved" to proceed.

You: Mode Approved

AI: ✅ Executing plan...
    [implements each checklist item]
    [updates structure doc]
    [records session]
```

### Quick UI Tweak

```
You: Mode Free - Change button color from blue to green

AI: ⚡ Free mode active — skipping planning, still documenting

    [Makes change]
    [Updates session log]

    Done. Return to planned work with "Mode Proceed".
```

### Fixing a Bug

```
You: Mode Fix - Login form throwing 500 error

AI: 🔧 Fix mode activated
    [Creates fix plan]

    Found: Missing DATABASE_URL env var
    Fix plan: Add var → Update connection settings

    Approve fix?

You: Mode Approved

AI: [Implements fix]
    [Documents in reports/ why error occurred]
```

### End of Session

```
You: Mode Finish

AI: 📊 Generating final summary...
    - Completed: User profile page
    - Files modified: 5
    - Structure updated: Yes

    Handoff document created. Use "Mode Start" next session.
```

---

## ✅ Best Practices

**DO:**
- ✅ Start every session with `Mode Start`
- ✅ Always review plans before approving
- ✅ Use `Mode Free` sparingly — only tiny tweaks
- ✅ Run `Mode Finish` at natural stopping points
- ✅ Keep `docs/` updated with architecture decisions

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Never approve a plan without reading it
- ❌ Don't let AI implement without a plan (except `Mode Free`)
- ❌ Never ignore structure docs
- ❌ Don't let context grow too large — start fresh sessions

### Context Window Management

The AI monitors context and alerts you at 80%:

```
⚠️ Context at 82% — recommend new chat
   Summary written to summaries/
   Start fresh with "Mode Start" to continue
```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**AI seems confused or off-track:**
```
You: Mode Reset

AI: 🔄 Resetting... rereading entire .codestacker system
    ✅ System reloaded
```

**Missing documentation:**
```
AI: ⚠️ Missing: project/structure/02_database_schema.sql
    Please provide your database type and existing tables.
```

**AI made a mistake:**
```
You: Mode Report

AI: 📝 Documenting failure...
    Report saved to reports/
    Ready to proceed with fix.
```

---

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I need to use all the folders?**
A: Yes — each folder serves a critical purpose. The system works as a whole.

**Q: Can I use this with any AI assistant?**
A: Yes. `.codestacker` works with any AI that can read/write files — GPT, Gemini, Cursor, Copilot, and more.

**Q: What if I'm starting a brand new project?**
A: Use `Mode New Project` first. The AI will guide setup.

**Q: How do I hand off to another developer?**
A: Run `Mode Finish` — it generates a complete handoff doc in `summaries/handoff_notes.md`.

**Q: Can I customize the rules?**
A: Yes — use `Mode Rule` to add project-specific rules, saved in `rules/`.

**Q: What if the AI isn't following the system?**
A: Try `Mode Reset`. If that doesn't work, check `reports/` for drift patterns and tighten rules with `Mode Rule`.

**Q: What if I need a skill that isn't installed?**
A: The AI auto-builds a starter skill on the spot using the Skill Builder. For engineering-grade skills, browse [codestacker.co](https://codestacker.co) or the [CodeStacker-Skills](https://github.com/CoSama-Ai/CodeStacker-Skills) community repo.
